            I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science at University
            of St. La Salle. I have always been fascinated by the power of
            technology to solve problems and make a difference in the world. In
            my free time, I enjoy tinkering with code and building my own
            websites and applications. I am also active in my school's computer
            science club, where I have had the opportunity to work on
            collaborative projects and attend industry events. After graduation,
            I hope to work at a tech company where I can continue to learn and
            grow as a developer.
